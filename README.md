## Overview

##### Goal:
This web application aims to be an online travel journal for its users that focuses on travel and experiences through simplicity of the UI.
#
##### Motivation:
People can always buy their own paper world map and put physical pins in the places they’ve traveled to around the world, but how can we make this experience more interactive and shareable to other travel enthusiasts? |

##### Innovative Idea:
Introducing Around the World, an online travel journal that helps users visually track the places they’ve been to across the globe. In each of the locations the user wants to post to their profile, they can add pictures, write a bio, and rate their experience travelling there. There is also a social aspect to the app since users can follow and be followed by other users.

##### Stakeholders:
Dr. Mike is the project manager, while Anni, Victor, and Richard are the developers of the project. Any individual interested in using Around the World would be the users.

##### Application Domain:
Around the World is an application to track travel experiences and to connect its users in a meaningful way online.

##### Benefits to Users:
Similar to the motivation, creating a platform where users can focus on their travels and experiences without the clutter may provide a more positive experience than can be found on current social media. |
